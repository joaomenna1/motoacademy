    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> <u>is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry</u>. <br> <i>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since</i> the 1500s, 
        <br><b><u>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book </u></b>. <br>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the 
        leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
        passages, 
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
